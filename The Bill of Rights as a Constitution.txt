Akhil Reed Amar 

  We have already noted that the First and Second Amendments' references to "the people" implied a core collective right, echoing the Preamble's commitment to the ultimate sovereignty of "We the People of the United States." So too, as we shall see, with the Ninth and Tenth Amendments' use of that phrase.  Indeed, the historian Lawrence Cress has argued that in constitutions in "state after state, [the phrases] 'the people' or 'the militia' [were used to connote] the sovereign citizenry, described collectively." In contrast, "the expression, 'man' or 'person' [was typically] used to describe individual rights such as freedom of conscience."   n200 The Virginia  ratifying convention's declaration of rights followed a similar pattern, invoking "the people's" rights to assembly, instruction, speech, press, and armsbearing -- political rights all -- but using "every freeman" and "man" language in connection with a variety of civil rights involving due process and criminal procedure safeguards.   n201 The Virginia prototype of the Fourth Amendment fell in the latter category -- "every freeman has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and siezures [sic] of his person. . . ."   n202 This formulation followed the general outlines of the search and seizure clause of the highly influential Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 and its New Hampshire lookalike, and was in turn echoed by ratifying conventions in New York and North Carolina.   n203 Madison was surely aware of these formulations, given his leading role in the Virginia convention, but his initial proposal instead invoked "the people"   n204 -- language that survived all subsequent congressional modifications.  In the search and seizure context, this formulation had appeared in only a single state constitution -- the rather atypical Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, penned before the American reconceptualization of English popular sovereignty theory reached full flower.   n205


The dominant strategy to keep agents of the central government under control was to use the populist and local institution of the jury.
a.  Jurors as Populist Protectors
Guaranteed in no less than three amendments, juries were at the heart of the Bill of Rights.  The Fifth safeguarded the role of the grand jury; the Sixth, the criminal petit jury; and the Seventh, the civil jury.  In addition, Madison's unsuccessful Fourteenth Amendment would have explicitly guaranteed jury trial against state governments.   n231 What's more, trial by jury in all criminal cases had earlier been mandated by the clear words of Article III: "The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury." Indeed, the entire debate at the Philadelphia convention over whether to add a Bill of Rights was triggered when George Mason picked up on a casual comment from another delegate that "no provision was yet made for juries in civil cases."   n232 Between the close of the Philadelphia convention and the opening of the first Congress, five of the six state ratifying conventions that proposed amendments put forth two or more juryrelated proposals.   n233 State constitutions further confirm the centrality of the jury.  According to Leonard Levy's tally, the only right secured in all state constitutions penned between 1776 and 1787 was the right of jury trial in criminal cases.   n234
Spanning both civil and criminal proceedings, the key role of the jury was to protect ordinary individuals against governmental overreaching.  Jurors would be drawn from the community; like the militia they were ordinary Citizens, not permanent government officials on the government payroll.  Just as the militia could check a paid professional standing army, so too the jury could thwart overreaching by powerful and ambitious government officials.
The grand jury, for example, could thwart any prosecution it deemed unfounded or malicious -- especially if it suspected that the executive was trying  to use the powers of incumbency illegitimately to entrench itself in power by prosecuting its political critics.  Note how the Fifth Amendment differs from the Fourth.  In contrast to the Fourth's warrant clause, the decision whether sufficient cause exists to prosecute a felony can never under the Fifth be made solely by permanent government officials.  Perhaps because of this, the Fifth nowhere explicitly requires that the indictment be supported by a given level of "probable cause" or that the indictment or presentment "particularly describ[e]" the factual offenses charged.  Because the decision was to be made by a popular body, perhaps more flexibility was allowed, as within the Fourth Amendment itself.
More broadly, the grand jury had sweeping proactive and inquisitorial powers to investigate suspected wrongdoing or coverups by government officials and make its findings known through the legal device of "presentment" -- a public document stating its accusations.  Presentments were not limited to indictable criminal offenses.  The grand jury had a roving commission to ferret out official malfeasance or self-dealing of any sort and bring it to the attention of the public at large.  In the words of James Wilson:
The grand jury are a great channel of communication, between those who make and administer the laws, and those for whom the laws are made and administered.  All the operations of government, and of its ministers and officers, are within the compass of their view and research.  They may suggest publick improvements and the modes of removing publick inconveniences: they may expose to publick inspection, or to publick punishment, publick bad men, and publick bad measures.   n235
 
This vision of the grand jury was nicely illustrated by the events of 1816; the congressional pay increase noted earlier was the target of several grand jury proceedings that helped inform and mobilize the electorate about "public bad men and publick bad measures."   n236
In cases where an indictable criminal offense had occurred, the grand jury was unable to compel prosecution on its own initiative without the concurrence of the executive, but could nonetheless use presentments to publicize to the people at large any suspicious executive decisions to decline prosecution.   n237 The image here is akin to that of modern-day blue ribbon commissions and special prosecutors called to investigate in areas where regular government officials may have conflicts of interest.  By focusing public attention on otherwise low-visibility executive decisions, the grand jury could deter executive self-dealing and enhance executive accountability.
 Though not as proactive as its "grand" counterpart, the criminal petit jury could interpose itself on behalf of "the people's" rights by refusing to convict when the executive sought to trump up charges against its political critics.  Once again, more than a permanent government official -- even an independent Article III judge -- was required to safeguard liberty.  In England, judges had too often acquiesced in government tyranny, as the cases of Pyrnne and Wilkes (tried in absentia for seditious libel) graphically illustrated.   n238 Even in America, federal judges would be appointed by the central government, and might prove reluctant to rein in their former benefactors and current paymasters -- as illustrated by the brazenly partisan conduct of some Federalist judges during the Sedition Act controversy.   n239 Thus in those aspects of a criminal case that might involve a judge acting without a jury -- issuing arrest warrants, setting bail, and sentencing -- additional restrictions came into play via the Fourth Amendment warrant clause and the Eighth Amendment.
The petit jury's power would be especially great if it could lawfully refuse to convict a defendant charged under any federal law it deemed unconstitutional.  As we shall see below, this right of "jury review" was advocated by many constitutional theorists in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and was invoked by publishers accused of violating the Sedition Act.   n240
A Sixth Amendment right of "jury review" gains added plausibility when we remember the central role of the Seventh Amendment civil jury in adjudicating the Fourth Amendment issue of "reasonableness." Here, the order of the parties was typically reversed -- the target of government harassment would be the plaintiff, and a government official the defendant -- but the basic idea was the same.  Ordinary Citizens would check executive overreaching and monitor the professional judiciary.
As Tocqueville observed, the overall jury system was fundamentally populist and majoritarian:
The institution of the jury . . . places the real direction of society in the hands of the governed, . . . and not in that of the government. . . .  [It] invests the people, or that class of citizens, with the direction of society. . . .  The jury system as it is understood in America appears to me to be as direct and as extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as universal suffrage.  They are two instruments of equal power, which contribute to the supremacy of the majority.   n241
 b.  Jurors as Provincials
The jury was not simply a popular body, but a local one as well.  Indeed, the Sixth Amendment explicitly guaranteed a jury "of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed," going a step beyond the language of Article III, which required only that jury trials be held somewhere within the state where the crime occurred.  Early in the Philadelphia convention, Madison captured an important truth in a telling analogy, arguing for the need to " preserve the State rights, as carefully as the trials by jury."   n242 Just as state legislators could protect their constituents against central oppression, so too jurors could obviously "interpose" themselves against central tyranny through the devices of presentments, nonindictments, and general verdicts.  As with the militia, the jury would be composed of Citizens from the same community and its actions were expected to be informed by community values.
c.  Jurors as Pupils
The jury was also to be informed by judges -- most obviously in the judges' charges.  As Ralph Lerner has shown in his essay on "Republican Schoolmasters," judges often seized the occasion to educate the jurors about legal and political values, ranging well beyond the narrow issues before them.   n243 Like the church and the militia, the jury was in part an intermediate association de-signed to educate and socialize its members into virtuous thinking and conduct.  Churches stressed religious and moral virtues; militias struck a proper balance between civilian and martial virtues; and juries instilled republican legal and political virtues.
No one understood all this better than Tocqueville, a keen student of American constitutional law and the leading theorist on the importance of intermediate associations:
The jury, and more especially the civil jury, serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for free institutions.  It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing judged and with the notion of right. . . .  It teaches men to practice equity; every man learns to judge his neighbor as he would himself be judged. . . .
. . . It may be regarded as a gratuitous public school, ever open, in which every juror learns his rights, enters into daily communication with the most learned and enlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes practically acquainted with the laws, which are brought within the reach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the judge, and even the passions of the parties. . . .
 . . . I look upon [the jury] as one of the most efficacious means for the education of the people which society can employ.   n244
Through the jury, Citizens would learn self-government by doing self-government.  In Tocqueville's memorable phrase, "the jury, which is the most energetic means of making the people rule, is also the most efficacious means of teaching it how to rule well."   n245 In 1789, the Anti-Federalist "Maryland Farmer" noted that although ordinary folk were "much degraded in the powers of the mind," jury service would uplift them.  "Give them power and they will find understanding to use it."   n246
d.  Jurors as Political Participants
Unable to harbor any realistic expectations about serving in the small House of Representatives or the even more aristocratic Senate, ordinary Citizens could nevertheless participate in the application of national law through their service on juries.   n247 In the words of the "Federal Farmer," the leading Anti-Federalist essayist of the ratification period, through juries "frequently drawn from the body of the people . . . we secure to the people at large, their just and rightful controul in the judicial department."   n248 Juries, wrote another republican in 1791, give the people "a share of Judicature which they have reserved for themselves."   n249 As the most prominent historian of Anti-Federalist thought, Herbert J. Storing, has written, "The question was not fundamentally whether the lack of adequate provision for jury trial would weaken a traditional bulwark of individual rights (although that was also involved) but whether it would fatally weaken the role of the people in the administration of government."   n250
 Analogies between legislatures and juries abounded.   n251 Wrote the "Federal Farmer":
It is essential in every free country, that common people should have a part and share of influence, in the judicial as well as in the legislative department . . . .
The trial by jury in the judicial department, and the collection of the people by their representatives in the legislature . . . have procured for them, in this country, their true proportion of influence, and the wisest and most fit means of protecting themselves in the community.  Their situation, as jurors and representatives, enables them to acquire information and knowledge in the affairs and government of the society; and to come forward, in turn, as the centinels and guardians of each other.   n252
So, too, Jefferson declared in 1789 that "it is necessary to introduce the people into every department of government. . . .  Were I called upon to decide whether the people had best be omitted in the Legislative or Judicial department, I would say it is better to leave them out of the Legislative."   n253 Tocqueville later made much the same point:
The jury is, above all, a political [and not a mere judicial] institution . . . .
. . . The jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution of the laws is entrusted, as the legislature is that part of the nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be governed in a fixed and uniform manner, the list of citizens qualified to serve on juries must increase and diminish with the list of electors.   n254
Even more elaborate was the vision of the jury conjured up by John Taylor of Caroline, one of the early Republic's leading constitutional theorists.  The  jury, wrote Taylor, was the "lower judicial bench" in a bicameral judiciary.   n255 The judicial structure mirrored that of the legislature, with an upper house of greater stability and experience, and a lower house to represent popular sentiment more directly.  In a similar vein, the "Maryland Farmer" defined the jury as "the democratic branch of the judiciary power -- more necessary than representatives in the legislature."   n256
Tocqueville explicitly defined the jury as "a certain number of citizens chosen by lot and invested with a temporary" commission   n257 -- the analogy to militias suggests itself once again -- and the "Federal Farmer" also seemed to stress the rotating quality of jury service, as evidenced by his final reference, quoted above, to Citizens coming forward "in turn." The idea of mandatory rotation once again illustrates the connections between juries and legislators, for many Anti-Federalists wanted compulsory rotation in the legislature as well.   n258 Indeed, Thomas Jefferson's two biggest objections to the original Constitution were its lack of a bill of rights and its abandonment of the republican principle of mandatory rotation.   n259 At the New York ratifying convention Gilbert Livingston criticized the lack of mandatory rotation in the legislature, but his comments fit the jury context as well:
[Rotation] will afford opportunity to bring forward the genius and information of the states, and will be a stimulus to acquire political abilities.  It will be the means of diffusing a more general knowledge of the measures and spirit of the administration.  These things will confirm the people's confidence in government.   n260
 
Like so many other ideas we have seen, the mandatory rotation principle drew its strength from structural concerns about attenuated representation rather than elaborate ideas about minority rights.
 e.  The Centrality of the Jury
If we seek a paradigmatic image underlying the Bill of Rights, we cannot go far wrong in picking the jury.  Not only was it featured in three separate amendments (the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh), but its absence strongly influenced the judge-restricting doctrines underlying three other amendments (the First, Fourth, and Eighth).  So too, the double jeopardy clause, which makes no explicit mention of juries, should be understood to safeguard not simply the individual defendant's interest in avoiding vexation, but also the integrity of the initial petit jury's judgment (much like the Seventh Amendment's rule against "re-examin[ation]" of the civil jury's verdict).   n261 The due process clause also implicated the jury, for its core meaning was to require lawful indictment or presentment (thus triggering the Fifth Amendment grand jury clause).   n262 Even those amendments that at first seem rather far afield appear on closer inspection to resonate with the values underlying the jury.  We have seen important parallels between the jury and the Second Amendment's vaunted "well regulated Militia." The vision underlying the jury also harmonizes well with Congress' first two (unsuccessful) amendments, which reflected suspicion of government agents on the permanent payroll and too far removed from the people.  The jury summed up -- indeed embodied -- the ideals of populism, federalism, and civic virtue that were the essence of the original Bill of Rights.
If the foregoing picture of the jury seems somewhat unconventional, perhaps the reason is that the present day jury is only a shadow of its former self.  First Amendment doctrine has evolved beyond the prohibition against prior restraint, while the judge-created and judge-enforced exclusionary rule has displaced the jury trial for damages as the central enforcement mechanism of the Fourth Amendment -- in part because of judge-created doctrines of government officials'  immunity from damages.   n263 As we shall now see, even the core role of the jury in criminal trials has been seriously eroded over the last two centuries.
(i) Jury Review
Consider first the issue of jury review.  Let us begin by defining the question with precision.  First, the issue is not the general one of jury nullification (can a jury disregard a law it thinks unjust?), but the narrower question of whether a jury can refuse to follow a law if and only if it deems that law unconstitutional.   n264 The concept is exactly analogous to the idea of judicial review, as traditionally understood.  Judges may not ignore a law simply because they think it wrong, or unjust, or silly; but they may -- indeed must -- do so if they deem it unconstitutional.  Second, the question is not whether a jury has the raw power of review by entering a general verdict and "getting away with it" -- i.e., escaping sanctions that would affect the Holmesian "bad man." Rather, the question is whether a jury has the legal right -- perhaps even the duty -- to refuse to follow a law it deems unconstitutional.  As a practical matter, the issue often boils down to whether an attorney should be allowed to argue unconstitutionality, typically as a defense, to a jury.
This is exactly how the issue arose in perhaps the most famous of all Sedition Act prosecutions, United States v. Callender,   n265 tried in 1800 in a federal Circuit Court.  When the publisher Callender's attorney, William Wirt, tried to argue the statute's unconstitutionality to the jury, he was cut off by presiding Circuit Justice Samuel Chase.  Chase was later impeached for his overall handling of Callender, and for refusing to allow defense counsel in another criminal case to argue law to the jury.  About half of the Senate voted to convict, several votes short of the two-thirds required by the Constitution.   n266 Wirt, by contrast, went on to become "one of the greatest Supreme Court advocates of all time and the man who holds the record for years of service as Attorney General."   n267 Here is an edited transcript of the Chase-Wirt exchange:
Here CHASE, Circuit Justice -- Take your seat, sir, if you please.  If I understand you rightly, you offer an argument to the petit jury, to  convince them that the . . . Sedition Law[] is contrary to the constitution of the United States and, therefore, void.  Now I tell you that this is irregular and inadmissible; it is not competent to the jury to decide on this point . . . .
. . . [W]e all know that juries have the right to decide the law, as well as the fact -- and the constitution is the supreme law of the land, which controls all laws which are repugnant to it.
Mr. Wirt. -- Since, then, the jury have a right to consider the law, and since the constitution is law, the conclusion is certainly syllogistic, that the jury have a right to consider the constitution.
CHASE, Circuit Justice. -- A non sequitur, sir.
Here Mr. Wirt sat down.   n268
Chase went on to try to explain his ruling, but if anything, it is his arguments that border on non sequitur.  At times he seemed to say that if the jury could consider constitutionality, it would necessarily follow that judges could not.  But nothing in the idea of judicial review, or in the subsequent Marbury case, requires that only judges consider constitutionality.   n269 Surely, for example, President Jefferson was within his constitutional rights -- perhaps duties -- when he pardoned those convicted under the Sedition Act because he deemed the Act unconstitutional, notwithstanding that Article III Circuit Courts had held to the contrary in cases involving the very convicts in question.  Judges took oaths to uphold the Constitution, as Marbury emphasized, but so did Presidents and jurors.  In his celebrated 1791 lectures on law, James Wilson, who had been second (if that) only to Madison in his contributions to the Constitution, declared: "[W]hoever would be obliged to obey a constitutional law, is justified in refusing to obey an unconstitutional act of the legislature - . . . .  [W]hen a question, even of this delicate nature, occurs, every one who is called to act, has a right to judge."   n270 Though Wilson did not single out juries by name, surely they were "called to act" when requested to send James Callender to jail.  Theophilus Parsons, who would one day sit as Chief Justice of his state supreme court, was even more explicit in the Massachusetts ratifying convention:
But, sir, the people themselves have it in their power effectually to resist usurpation, without being driven to an appeal to arms.  An act of usurpation is not obligatory; it is not law; and any man may be justified in his resistance.  Let him be considered as a criminal by the general government, yet only his own fellow-citizens can convict him; they are his jury, and if they pronounce him innocent, not all the powers of  Congress can hurt him; and innocent they certainly will pro-nounce him, if the supposed law he resisted was an act of usur-pation.   n271
Likewise, Marbury's sonorous claim that "it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is"   n272 does not necessarily support Chase.  As Taylor's bicam-eral image illustrates, juries can be seen as part of the judicial department -- the lower (and if anything, presumptively more le-gitimate, because more popular) house.   n273 Just as both House and Senate had to agree the Sedition Bill was constitutional be-fore it became law, why shouldn't both judge and jury be required to agree on its constitutionality before Callender was sent to jail?  Nor was today's strict law/fact distinction between the roles of upper and lower judicial houses so clear in 1800.  On the contrary, it was widely believed in late eighteenth-century Amer-ica that the jury, when rendering a general verdict, could take upon itself the right to decide both law and fact.   n274 So said a unanimous Supreme Court in one of its earliest cases (decided before Callender),   n275 in language that resonates with the writings of some of the most eminent American lawyers of the age -- Jefferson, Adams, and Wilson, to mention just three.   n276 In-deed, Chase himself went out of his way to concede that juries were judges of law as well as of fact.   n277 Perhaps, however, this concession had to do with the pecularities of sedition law and its somewhat unusual procedures -- driven, it will be re-called, by the struggle between judge and jury.  In any event, the line between constitutional law and constitutional fact is often hazy, as illustrated by the "reasonableness" issue in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.   n278
Chase also suggested that decentralized jury review would under-mine the idea of uniform national law -- one jury might acquit on constitutional grounds, another might not -- but the same thing can be said of Article III judicial review.   n279  Through its power to make exceptions to the Supreme Court's appellate juris-diction, Congress can vest the last word in constitutional cases in lower federal courts who, like juries, might disagree among themselves.   n280 The Callender case was itself a remarkable ex-ample of this truth, for under the Judiciary Act of 1789 the Su-preme Court lacked jurisdiction to hear this or any other criminal appeal from Circuit Courts.   n281 (Thus, the most important con-stitutional issue of the Federalist era never reached the Supreme Court.) Truly, the situation under the Judiciary Act of 1789 was even more decentralized than this.  Trials in Circuit Court, such as Callender's, were presided over by two or even three judges.  In the event these judges disagreed among themselves, whose in-structions must the jury follow?  If anything, the very structure of the judges' hierarchy implied a radical decentralization and nonuniformity wholly consistent with jury review.   n282
But would not such a decentralized system lead to confusion and anarchy?  Not in any single case, given the Constitution's rather clear procedural structure for aggregating substantive disagree-ment.  In general, these rules work in a systematically anti-governmental, pro-populist way.  In the event any major institu-tional actor at the federal level deems a federal law unconstitu-tional, that institution is typically able to make its constitu-tional objection stick -- at least in criminal law, where persons' lives, liberties, and property are most vulnerable.  If either House or Senate deems a criminal bill unconstitutional, it cannot become law; and no person can be convicted in the absence of such a law, because there is no such thing as a "federal common law" of crimes.   n283 If the President deems the bill unconstitutional, he may veto or pardon (even before indictment).  So too, if judges deem the law unconstitutional, they may order the defendant re-leased and make their decision stick through the Great Writ of ha-beas corpus.  By symmetric logic, juries too should be allowed to use their power to issue a general verdict for defendant to achieve the same result.
 Chase's final argument simply asserted the jury's lack of "com-petence" to decide the Sedition Act's (un)constitutionality.  Judges were learned in law, and juries were not.  Though this may seem quite obvious today, perhaps the reason is that we have lost the powerful and prevailing sense of 200 years ago that the Con-stitution was the people's law.  Even if juries generally lacked competence to adjudicate intricate and technical "lawyer's law," the Constitution was not supposed to be a prolix code.  It had been made, and could be unmade at will, by We the People of the United States -- Citizens acting in special single-issue assem-blies (ratifying conventions), asked to listen, deliberate, and then vote up or down.  How, it might be asked, were juries differ-ent from conventions in this regard? If ordinary Citizens were competent to make constitutional judgments when signing petitions or assembling in conventions, why not in juries too?  Is there not an important truth in Jefferson's exuberant 1789 definition of jury trials as "trials by the people themselves"?   n284
In setting forth the strong arguments for jury review, I do not mean to suggest that I am wholly persuaded.  But the mere fact of their strong plausibility shows how strikingly powerful the jury might have become, had post-1800 history unfolded differently.  As previously noted, the Supreme Court never heard Callender or any other Sedition Act case, and indeed, did not definitively address the issue of jury review until the 1895 case of Sparf and Hansen v. United States.   n285 In upholding Chase's approach, the Sparf Court added no real arguments beyond those canvassed above.  The strongest defense of its holding comes from provisions never cited by the Court, namely the Civil War Amendments.  These amendments did not repeal the fundamentally populist philosophy of the origi-nal Constitution and Bill of Rights, but they did radically trans-form the nature of American federalism.  As Jefferson and Taylor understood all too well, acceptance of Wirt's argument for jury review would have created in fundamentally local bodies a power that approached de facto nullification in a wide range of situa-tions.  Existence of such a power in local bodies to nullify Con-gress' Reconstruction statutes might have rendered the Civil War Amendments a virtual dead letter.  Thus it is plausible to think that these Amendments implicitly qualified the (equally implicit) power of local juries to thwart national laws.  This, however, was hardly an argument that lay in the mouth of the Sparf Court.  In the previous two decades, the Supreme Court had itself systemati-cally destroyed congressional Reconstruction with the scalpel of stingy statutory construction and the sledgehammer of judicial re-view.   n286

n217 Accord T. TAYLOR, supra note 209, at 21-50.  Professor Tay-lor offers a wealth of historical evidence against collapsing the Fourth Amendment's distinct requirements, but nowhere suggests the possible relevance of jury trial issues.  Although Professor Nel-son suggests that arrests and searches always required warrants in colonial Massachusetts, W. NELSON, supra note 212, at 17-18, he elsewhere cites two early nineteenth-century cases holding that no arrest warrant was needed "in cases of treason and felony, and . . . to preserve the peace and to prevent outrage." Id. at 226 n.126.  The later cases accord with Professor Taylor's extensive evidence, and with Blackstone.  4 W. BLACKSTONE, supra note 90, at *286-90.

n221 The linkage between juries and Fourth Amendment interests was most vividly articulated in the following passage from an Anti-Federalist essayist:
[If a federal constable searching] for stolen goods, pulled down the clothes of a bed in which there was a woman and searched under her shift . . . a trial by jury would be our safest resource, heavy damages would at once punish the offender and deter others from committing the same; but what satisfaction can we expect from a lordly [judge] always ready to protect the officers of govern-ment against the weak and helpless citizens. . . .
PENNSYLVANIA AND THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 1787-1788, at 154 (J. McMaster & F. Stone eds. 1888); see also id. at 781-82 (remarks of Robert Whitehill at Pennsylvania ratifying convention).  Immedi-ately after criticizing the Constitution's inadequate provisions for jury trial, Whitehill invoked "The Case of Mr. Wilkes" -- a trespass action that had been tried to a jury -- and argued that "the Doctrine of general Warrants show[s] that Judges may be cor-rupted."

Professor McConnell's analysis helps to explain why the takings clause applied only against the federal government.  To the extent his explanation works, the takings clause is that much smaller an exception to my overall thesis about the Bill of Rights.

n261 The only state constitutional precursor of the double jeop-ardy clause conjoined this provision to its criminal jury trial guarantee.  N.H. CONST. of 1784, pt. I, art. I, � XVI.  The Mary-land state ratifying convention -- one of only two that raised the double jeopardy issue -- made this linkage even more explicit: "That there shall be a trial by jury in all criminal cases . . . and that there be no appeal from matter of fact, or second trial after acquittal." This clause was immediately followed by a proto-Seventh Amendment bar on appellate relitigation of facts found by a civil jury.  2 ELLIOT'S DEBATES, supra note 40, at 550; see also 3 J. STORY, supra note 90, at � 1781 (double jeopardy clause pro-hibits second trial after defendant "has once been convicted, or acquitted of the offence charged, by the verdict of a jury. . . .  But it does not mean, that he shall not be tried for the offence a second time, if the jury have been discharged without giving any verdict; or, if, having given a verdict, judgment has been ar-rested upon it, or a new trial has been granted in his favor . . . ").  Story's position is in some tension with current double jeop-ardy doctrine in America, but appears well supported by British practice, both then and now.  J. SIGLER, DOUBLE JEOPARDY 15-16, 32 n.138, 126-28 (1969).  It also may well make more sense than cur-rent doctrine, id. at 42, 127, 223.

KENT, COMMENTARIES ON AMERICAN LAW 13 (2d ed. 1832) (parroting Coke's definition of due process of law, quoted supra); 3 J. STORY, supra note 90, at � 1783 (similar).  Here, as elsewhere, I do not argue that the clause cannot be ap-plied beyond what I have called its "core" meaning.  Indeed, re-fusal to do so here would render the provision wholly redundant, as the Supreme Court has noted.  Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 276 (1856).

This view of the power of American juries was articulated as early as 1692.  L. LEVY, supra note 96, at 24-25.  Even Alexander Hamilton seems to have believed that juries in criminal cases could decide both law and fact, and disregard the bench's instructions on law -- or so he argued as defense counsel in 1803.  See Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U.S. 51, 147-48 (1895) (Gray and Shiras, J.J., dissenting).  But cf. Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 HARV. L.

n283 See United States v. Hudson & Goodwin, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 (1812). The Hudson case raises many complications, but I would distill its central insight as follows: In the absence of express congressional authorization, federal courts may not fashion gen-eral criminal rules -- especially where Congress' constitutional authority to enact identical rules is in question.  I would defend this insight by invoking the structure of the original Constitu-tion (i.e., separation of powers, federalism, and their intersec-tion through "the political safeguards of federalism"), the Con-stitution's own heightened procedural rules governing criminal sanctions, and general rules requiring strict construction where penal policy is involved.  Thus, various earlier federal judicial decisions in tension with Hudson were dubious precedents indeed, defensible only if Congress in the First Judiciary Act meant to delegate its own (limited) criminal authority to federal courts, and such a sweeping statutory grant somehow did not violate con-stitutional norms of nondelegation.  See Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, � 11 (giving Circuit Courts "exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United States" subject to certain exceptions).
